##0 Tulimshar finally approved Carston's plans to move his
##0 inn towards the residential district and the planned
##0 trade route. The one condition was that he clean up the
##0 mess that would be left behind. He reciprocated by

##0 in with the warp gates. You may have find a new place
##0 to sit....

##0 Pachua has found out about the snake that has started
##0 prowling around the Land of Fire. Grind some Black
##0 Mambas, collect their drops, and head out to the desert
##0 to get some new gear by Ozthokk!
